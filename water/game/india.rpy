  "Now how does climate change affect water in India? 70\% of India’s economy depends on the annual monsoons, which means that India depends on natural external causes for multiple facets of life. Here we have Lakshmi, and her friend Durga who will unknowingly find out how much water really has control over their lives."
  l normal"I can’t believe we were able to get out of school two hours early! Typically it feels like we have to stay after."
  d normal "Yeah, but don’t you think our teacher seemed a little weird about it? He seemed a little startled when he told us."
  l normal"I’m sure it’s just temporary, probably something happened with the power breaker. "
  d normal "I just have a bad feeling about this… "

  "Meteorologists predict that the monsoons will come later this year, causing lack of hydroelectricity for the city and irrigation for plants."

  d normal "I told you! This has to be the reason that school let us out early. Who knows how long we will be out of school if it depends on the monsoon."
  l normal " I doubt it Durga! My parents said those meteorologists are phonies who get paid to say nothing in every word possible. Let’s just get some kulfi for you to feel better, I bet Kabir will let us get some gajar ka halwa for free again too! "

  "As the two approach Kabir’s stand, they see him flip the sign to close. Lakshmi looks at her watch and sees that it is only 4 PM. The two look at each other in confusion, but continue heading towards him. "
  l normal "Kabir! Don’t tell me you ran out of Kulfi already! Was business really that good today?"
  k normal "Hello ladies… Unfortunately, I did not run out of kulfi, but rather I must find an alternate way to store my desserts before they spoil. The electricity outage means that if I do not go to the next town fast enough, the kulfi will melt and be wasted."
  d normal "Oh no! How long will that take you?"
